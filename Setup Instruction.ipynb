    "## Deploying GPU Cluster on AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "Please go to EC2 dashboard and select `Launch Instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Choose AMI**: Launch `Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 22.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Choose an Instance Type**: Choose g3.4xlarge for testing multiple nodes with 1 GPU each\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3: Configure Instance**: Select 4 (however much you need) for `Number of instances` and leave the rest as default\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4: Add Storage**: Select 200GiB General Purpose. Adjust the size depending on how big the dataset is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5: Add Tags**: Skip this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 6: Configure Security Group**: Create a new security group and choose a name like `GPU-group` for keeping track of the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 7: Review**: Launch with your own key pair, such as `course-key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional configuration for the security group is required so that the nodes can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please go to `Security Groups` and edit the rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edit Inbound Rules**: Add rule with `all traffic` as `Type` and `Custom` with this security group (type in `GPU-group` and will show the security group id) as `Source`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edit Outbound Rules**: Same as inbound.\n",

    "\n",
    "This setup needs to be done for each node individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "`source activate pytorch_p36`\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the name of private IP of the node by running `ifconfig` (usually `ens3`) and export it to NCLL socket:\n",
    "\n",
    "`export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=ens3` (add to `.bashrc` to make this change permanent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload the scripts to each node or git clone from the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, upload the data to each node if running without NFS (Network File System) setup.\n",

    "## Running the code\n",

    "For each node run:\n",

    "where `<#GPU per Node>` is the number of GPUs in each node; `<Total # of Nodes>` is the total number of nodes; `<i>` is the rank assigned to this node (starting from 0 = master node); `<Master Node Private IP>` the private IP of master node which can be found by running `ifconfig` under `ens3`; `<Free Port>` any free port.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, running 2 nodes would be:\n",

    "## Configure NFS for file sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is inspired by `Harvard CS205 - Spring 2019 - Infrastructure Guide - I7 - MPI on AWS`, but with modifications to bypass the extra user account created, which is unnecessary in this setting.\n",

    "- Update the changes: `master$ sudo exportfs -a`\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure the NFS client on other nodes:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Create NFS directory: `node$ mkdir cloud`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mount the shared directory: `node$ sudo mount -t nfs <Master Node Private IP>:/home/ubuntu/cloud /home/ubuntu/cloud`\n",
    "\n",
