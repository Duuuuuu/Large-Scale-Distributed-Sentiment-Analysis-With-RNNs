    "### Uploading Files to S3 Bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new bucket with no special setting and upload the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `install_boto3_h5py.sh`: installs boto3 and h5py packages on each node in the cluster\n",
    "- `complete.json`: raw data\n",
    "- `mapper.py` and `reducer.py`: python files for the MapReduce task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deploying CPU Cluster on AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "Please go to EMR dashboard and select `Create cluster`, and then `Go to advanced options`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Software and Steps**: Choose `emr-5.8.0` Release and leave the rest as default\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Hardware**: At the bottom of the page, change instance type as `m4.xlarge` for Master and Core, and change to `8 Core Instances`, or however many needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3: General Cluster Settings**: Add `custom bootstrap action` by calling the script `install_boto3_h5py.sh`. This bash file will install boto3 and h5py packages on each node in the cluster. Could also rename cluster or enable logging, but these are not required\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4: Security**: Select `EC2 key pair` and create cluster\n",

    "### Running MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "After the cluster is started and bootstrapped, go to `Steps` tab and `Add step`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step type**: `Streaming program`\n",
    "- **Name**: optional\n",
    "- **Mapper**: path to your mapper file, e.g.`s3://BucketName/mapper.py`\n",
    "- **Reducer**: path to your reducer file, e.g.`s3://BucketName/reducer.py`\n",
    "- **Input S3 location**: path to your data file, e.g.`s3://BucketName/complete.json`\n",
    "- **Output S3 location**: input a non-existing folder name, e.g.`s3://BucketName/new_folder`\n",

    "### Launching Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Please go to EC2 dashboard and select `Launch Instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Choose AMI**: Launch `Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Choose an Instance Type**: Choose `m4.2xlarge`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3: Launch**: Launch with your own key pair, such as `course-key`.\n",

    "### Installing Essential Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "After connecting to the instance, you need to first install boto3 and h5py with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt update`\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt install python-pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install boto3`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install h5py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify Instance Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the EC2 dashboard, select `Volumes`, and modify the instance volume to 64GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1` on the instance and restart it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run `df -h`, you should find that the disk space has been expanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python File\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify bucket name and the names of the files to be combined in `combine_h5.py`. You can find the file names from the S3 bucket page. You may also adjust the output file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, upload the python file to instance and run it with `python combine_h5.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Make the preprocessed h5 data file public, in order for the following process to access it with its `Object URL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the S3 bucket, select the `Permissions` tab, and set all options under `Public access settings` to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the combined h5 file and `Make public` under the `Actions` tab.\n"
